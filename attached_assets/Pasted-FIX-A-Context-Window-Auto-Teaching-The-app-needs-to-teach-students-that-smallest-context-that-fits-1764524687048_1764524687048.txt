FIX A: Context Window Auto-Teaching
The app needs to teach students that "smallest context that fits = cheapest." Right now the dropdown is manual with no guidance.

Below the Input Gauge, add two lines of text:

Line 1: "Your prompt uses ~[X] tokens"
Line 2: "Recommended context: [smallest tier that fits] (lowest cost)"


Update the Context Window dropdown labels:

If prompt fits in 8K: "8K ✅ recommended"
"32K — higher cost"
"128K — much higher cost"
"1M — extreme cost"


If the prompt token count exceeds a tier's capacity:

Show that option in red text
Add "— won't fit" after the label
Make it unselectable or show warning if selected


Auto-select the smallest context tier that fits the prompt by default. Student can still override manually.


FIX B: Budget Cap Visibly Disables Models
The Max Cost slider needs to be a hard constraint, not just informational. Models that exceed the cap should be visually disabled.

When a model's estimated cost exceeds the current Max Cost slider value:

Gray out that model's entire card/column
Overlay or badge on the card: "Exceeds $[X.XX] cap"
Exclude that model from PICK badge consideration


The PICK badge should automatically shift to the best model still under budget
If ALL models exceed the budget cap:

Show a message below the cards: "No models fit your budget — increase cost cap or reduce context window"
No PICK badge should appear


As the user moves the cost slider, cards should gray out or light up in real-time


FIX C: Prompt Difficulty Nudge
Easy prompts (like "What is 2+2?" or "What is the capital of France?") make all models look equal, which undermines the capability labels (Basic → Excellent). Students need a nudge to try harder prompts.

After a test run completes, check if all models returned similar/correct answers
If yes, show a subtle prompt below the model cards (above the Pareto chart):

"💡 All models handled this one — try a harder prompt to see real capability differences"


Optional: Add a "Try a Challenge Prompt" button next to that message

Clicking it loads a pre-set harder prompt into the input field
Example prompts:

"Explain why 0.999... equals 1"
"Write a Python function to find the longest palindromic substring"
"A bat and ball cost $1.10 total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Explain your reasoning."


Rotate through different challenge prompts each time


Styling for the nudge:

Muted text color
Centered
Smaller font (14px)
Fade in after results load




Summary of changes:

Fix A teaches context optimization automatically
Fix B makes budget a real constraint students can see and feel
Fix C pushes students toward discovering capability differences

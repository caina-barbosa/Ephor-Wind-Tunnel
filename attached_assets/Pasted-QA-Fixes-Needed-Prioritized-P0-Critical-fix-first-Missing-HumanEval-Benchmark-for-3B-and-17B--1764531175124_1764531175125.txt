QA Fixes Needed — Prioritized
P0 - Critical (fix first):
Missing HumanEval Benchmark for 3B and 17B Models
Location: client/src/pages/chat.tsx lines 87, 121
Fix: Add humanEval values to benchmarks object for 3B and 17B, or explicitly show "N/A"
Missing HumanEval for Reasoning Models
Location: client/src/pages/chat.tsx lines 178, 195
Fix: Add humanEval values for DeepSeek R1 Distill 70B and DeepSeek R1, or show "N/A"
P1 - High Priority (fix after P0):
Pricing Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend
Frontend (chat.tsx) uses costPer1k
Backend (schema.ts) uses MODEL_PRICING per 1M tokens
Fix: Reconcile so cost estimates match actual server-side costs
Dependency Mismatch in useEffect
Location: client/src/pages/chat.tsx line 437
Fix: Add contextSize to dependency array, or refactor to avoid stale closure
Missing OpenRouter Model Mapping
Location: server/routes.ts lines 246-256
Fix: Add OpenRouter models to getActualModelId() mapping
PostCSS Warning
Fix: Update PostCSS plugin config to pass "from" option
P2 - Medium Priority (fix after P1):
Token estimation uses rough Math.ceil(text.length / 4) — consider noting this is approximate
getSkillTag() returns empty string for unknown columns — add fallback
Cost cap slider max is $0.25 — Frontier with large prompts can exceed this
Replace alert() calls with toast notifications (lines 867, 880, 921, 960, etc.)
Remove unused QWEN3_14B_MODEL_ID import from server/routes.ts
P3 - Low Priority (polish, do later):
17B column uses MoE model (17B active / 400B total) — consider clarifying for educational accuracy
min-w-[700px] forces horizontal scroll on mobile
Flag button only shows alert, doesn't actually flag
No seed data in Benchmark Library
No pagination for Leaderboard/Library
Latency shows full response time, not TTFT
Bundle size is 2.1mb — consider optimization
Replace confirm() with proper modal for delete
Add React error boundary at app root
Data Accuracy (verify when possible):
Claude Sonnet 4.5 MMLU/HumanEval — verify against official Anthropic data
Llama 4 Maverick benchmarks — verify accuracy
Security (address before production):
Add input sanitization for leaderboard prompts

1) “Over Budget” state
When it triggers

User lowers Max Cost Per Query below the cheapest eligible model in a size band given current context + reasoning settings.

Band / cell visual treatment

Fade band header to ~40% opacity.

Card background becomes a soft gray wash.

Replace model card content with an “Over budget” panel.

Keep the band visible (don’t remove), so students see what got eliminated.

Primary panel copy (inside the band)

Title:
Over budget for this band

Body (dynamic):
This size class can’t run under your $X.XX/query cap.

Cost breakdown (dynamic line):
Cheapest option here costs ~$Y.YY/query with your settings.

Why (1-liner, dynamic):
{Reasoning ON adds ~3–5× cost.} {Context increased to 32K adds ~Z× cost.}

CTA buttons:

Increase budget to $Y.YY (primary)

See cheaper bands (secondary anchor scrolls to cheapest eligible band)

Micro “learn more” link:
Why did this happen?

Tooltip / “Why did this happen?” explainer (short)

Header:
Why this band is locked out

Bullets (dynamic):

This band’s models cost more because they use more compute per token.

Your context window and reasoning mode increase compute.

Budget caps remove models that can’t fit within real-world constraints.

Footer mini-lesson:
Engineering rule: capability is useless if you can’t afford to run it.

Micro-interactions

On slider drag

As the cap crosses the threshold, the band animates into disabled state:

150ms fade + slight blur on old content

swap to Over Budget panel

A small toast appears once per drag (not spammy):

Toast:
Budget cap removed 70B band
Cheapest eligible cost is $Y.YY.

On hover over disabled band

Show a subtle outline + tooltip:

Tooltip:
Needs $Y.YY/query minimum with current context + reasoning.

On clicking “Increase budget”

Budget slider snaps to $Y.YY with a quick spring.

Band re-enables with reverse fade.

Tiny confirmation toast:

Toast:
Band restored under new cap.

2) “Context forced model swap” state
When it triggers

User increases context window (Auto → 32K/128K/1M), and the current model in a band no longer supports it.

System auto-selects the best eligible model within that band that does support the chosen context.

Band / cell visual treatment

Keep the card, but show a transition highlight.

Add a small banner at top of card for one run (dismisses after).

Banner copy (inside band, subtle)

Banner (info):
Model updated to fit 32K context

Subtext (dynamic):
Previous model maxed at 8K, so we switched to the next best option.

Inline link:
Compare old vs new

Expandable “Compare old vs new” mini drawer

Header:
What changed?

Before:

Model: {Old Model Name}

Max context: 8K

Est. cost: $A.AA/query

Capability: {label}

After:

Model: {New Model Name}

Max context: 32K

Est. cost: $B.BB/query

Capability: {label}

Why this matters (1 sentence):
Longer context lets the model “see” more, but costs more and may run slower.

Input gauge copy (near context control)

When user is near limit:

8K fits, but tight — risk of truncation if you add more.

When overflow:

Your prompt is 10,000 tokens. 8K will truncate ~2,000 tokens.

Micro-interactions

On selecting larger context

Run a band-by-band eligibility check.

For any band that must swap:

Card briefly highlights (soft yellow glow for 400ms).

Model name crossfades to new one.

Banner slides in from top (200ms).

If multiple bands swap

Show a single toast summary:

Toast:
Context change updated 3 bands
Some models don’t support 32K.

If a band has no model that supports the context

Replace card with a “No eligible model” state (different from over budget).

Title:
No models in this band support 128K

Body:
This size class tops out at 32K today.

CTA:

Lower context (primary)

Use larger bands (secondary)

On hover over the context dropdown

Add 1-line cost hint per option:

8K — lowest cost (recommended)

32K — higher cost

128K — much higher cost

1M — extreme cost

The tiny but crucial tone rule

Keep the copy engineering-neutral, not moralizing.
You’re teaching constraints, not scolding choices.
Your current voice already nails this; the above matches it.

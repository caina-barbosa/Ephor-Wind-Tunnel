Now that I can see the mock, I’d say:

Big picture:
The UI mostly matches your spec on shape and surface details (prompt → constraints → model grid), but it misses a few important teaching beats: how reasoning ties to model size, how context really constrains choices, and how the “wind tunnel” experiment plays out visually.

I’d call it ~80% aligned. Here’s a detailed pass.

1. Direct spec‑vs‑UI comparison
✅ “Across the top – parameters…”

Spec:

Across the top – parameters, with reasoning only on the biggest.

UI:

Top of the grid has: 3B, 7B, 17B, 70B, Frontier, with “Open Source / Closed Source” under each → good for “model size” + “open vs closed.”

Each column shows:

Est. cost

Capability (Basic / Good / Strong / Excellent)

MMLU %

HumanEval %

Input type (Text vs Vision)

Match:

You’re clearly teaching:

Size bands (3B, 7B, 17B, 70B, Frontier)

Open vs closed

Benchmarks (MMLU, HumanEval)

Multi‑modal (Vision vs Text)

Cost differences

Mismatch:

Reasoning is global, not tied to size:

“Reasoning Mode” is a single toggle in the top control bar, not something that is visually only available for the 70B / Frontier columns.

That loses your explicit teaching goal: “reasoning only on the biggest (good to teach kids why this is true).”

👉 Fix: Keep the global toggle, but show the consequence per column:

When Reasoning Mode is ON:

3B/7B columns show “Reasoning unreliable / disabled” (greyed out icon).

17B/70B/Frontier columns show “Reasoning enabled.”

Maybe add a small text under the grid:

“Deep reasoning only works well on large models (70B and Frontier).”

That ties the abstract idea (“big models reason better”) to a concrete visual.

✅/⚠️ “2nd row – context size – choose smallest that fits context submitted…”

Spec:

“2nd row – context size – choose smallest that fits context submitted.”

Students can override and choose a bigger window.

They should feel that bigger context → higher cost.

UI:

You have an “INPUT GAUGE” under the prompt showing 0 / 128,000 tokens 0.0%.

You have a “Context Window” control with a dropdown set to 128K tokens and a tag “Higher Cost.”

Match:

Context is clearly present as a primary control.

The “Higher Cost” tag hints that context size = money.

What’s missing for your spec:

There is no visible notion of “minimum context that fits” versus “you’re over‑allocating.”

Kids don’t see “we auto‑picked 128K because your prompt is X tokens; you can reduce/increase it.”

👉 Fix ideas:

Show two things near the Context Window:

“Your input: 18K tokens”

“Minimum required context: 32K” (highlighted)

Make the dropdown or pill group show tiers: 8K / 32K / 128K / 1M, with the smallest valid one auto‑selected and a little label:

“This is the smallest window that fits your input. Larger windows cost more.”

Use the Input Gauge bar to color the “wasted” part of the window (e.g., 18K used in a 128K context → lots of empty grey).

That turns context size from “weird number in a dropdown” into a felt constraint.

✅ “Explicit cost per query”

Spec:

should have an explicit – cost per query that the user wants to be max spend per query

UI:

You have a “Max Cost Per Query” slider with a dollar amount (e.g., $0.25).

Each model card shows “Est. Cost” for that model (per run or per 1k tokens—however you’ve defined it).

Match:

This is very close to the spec, and nicely literal.

What’s missing to fully land the lesson:

The UI doesn’t yet show which models are in‑budget vs out‑of‑budget.

Kids don’t see “I lowered my budget → Frontier is now greyed out.”

👉 Fix:

As the slider moves, dynamically:

Dim/lock any cards whose Est. Cost exceeds the max.

Label them “Over budget.”

Maybe add small markers on the cost slider showing where each model “enters” the budget range.

Now “deployment economics” is tangible: change budget → watch your lineup change.

⚠️ “System should then pick the best suggested model for each cell on the grid”

Spec:

The system, given cost + context + size, should suggest the “best” model per cell.

Grid should feel like “one cell = one model instance under these constraints.”

UI:

Each column has a single model (e.g., Llama 3.2 3B, Qwen 2.5 7B, etc.).

Nothing in the UI explains why those models were chosen or how they might change with constraints.

Partial match:

You are basically doing “best model per size bucket,” but it’s not explained as such.

To a student, it just looks like a static hand‑picked lineup.

👉 Fix:

Add a thin line of copy right above the grid:

“For each size band, we auto‑pick the best model that fits your cost + context constraints.”

When constraints change and a model switches (e.g., from one 7B model to another), highlight that change:

“Qwen 2.5 7B selected (best 7B within your budget).”

That makes the selection logic itself part of the learning.

⚠️ “System should realtime stream the answers to each cell… progress meter … click the cell to get the complete answer”

Spec:

No token‑by‑token text stream.

Instead:

Per‑cell progress meters (so you feel latency differences).

Finished cells are clickable to open the full answer in a popup.

UI:

Right now, each card just has a “Speed – Run test” row.

There’s no visible place (in the static state) where:

Progress would appear.

A “view answer” affordance would live.

Assuming you implement this behavior later, the layout has enough room, but the educational moment isn’t visible yet.

👉 Fix:

Turn the “Speed” row into a stateful area:

Idle: Run test

Running: a circular progress indicator + elapsed seconds

Done: Finished in 3.2s – View answer

Clicking anywhere on the card (or a button) should open a modal with:

The model’s answer

Cost & token usage for this run

Maybe a simple rubric (teacher or student graded).

This is what will really make it feel like a wind tunnel rather than a static comparison chart.

2. How well does it cover your “engineering dimensions” curriculum?

From your outline, students should eventually learn:

Open vs closed → ✅ surfaced at the top of each column.

Model size / parameters → ✅ 3B / 7B / 17B / 70B / Frontier.

Max context size → ✅ in Context Window + Input Gauge, but needs clearer teaching (see above).

Benchmarks → ✅ MMLU + HumanEval.

Multimodal → ✅ “Input: Vision/Text”.

Reasoning vs non‑reasoning → ⚠️ present as a global toggle but not tied to size.

Cost → ✅ Est. Cost + Max Cost slider.

Inference speed → ⚠️ implied via “Speed / Run test” but not yet visualized.

The more advanced items (architecture, training data, fine‑tuning, safety, RAG, etc.) can live nicely behind each column’s “Technical Details” dropdown and/or in Expert Mode. That’s actually a good separation: basic grid for intuition; deep dives for older/advanced kids.

3. Concrete tweaks that would make this perfectly match your spec

If I were handing a punch‑list to your designer/engineer, I’d say:

Tie reasoning to size, visibly.

Global “Reasoning Mode” toggle.

Per‑column badges: “Reasoning available” only on 70B + Frontier; “Not supported / unreliable” on 3B/7B.

Make context constraints explicit.

Show “Your input uses X tokens → minimum context Y.”

Use the Input Gauge to show waste when context >> usage.

Let students intentionally pick “overkill” and see the extra cost.

Wire cost slider into model availability.

Models above budget are dimmed and labeled “Over budget.”

Changing the slider visibly adds/removes models.

Upgrade the grid from “comparison table” to “experiment board.”

“Run Wind Tunnel Test” triggers all cards.

Each card shows progress + completion time.

Cards switch to “View answer” state when done.

Explain the weird words.

Tooltips or short labels for:

MMLU (“general knowledge + reasoning test”)

HumanEval (“coding test”)

This keeps it kid‑friendly while staying technically honest.

If you do those, the current mock isn’t just “on brand”; it becomes an accurate embodiment of your LLM wind tunnel spec and a genuinely powerful way for kids to feel speed, cost, and capability tradeoffs like real engineers.
